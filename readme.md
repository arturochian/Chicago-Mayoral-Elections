# Statistics: Learning from Data

## Examining Distributions

There are three ways to examine a distribution

1. Plot a Graph: This is the recommended first step to understanding a distribution. Using the appropriate graph helps visualize the data, look for patterns, detect outliers and understand the overall structure.
2. Compute a Statistic: While graphs are a powerful way to get started, there is a subjective element to its interpretation. Here is where a numerical summary measure of the data comes in handy. It is usually referred to as a **statistic**.
3. Fit a Model: 

### Plot Graphs

<div markdown = "0"> $\alpha$ </div>

### Compute Statistic

### Fit Density
